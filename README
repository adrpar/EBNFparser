This is a pragmatic attempt to build a EBNF parser for PHP, following the spirit
of the underlying original project: pragmatic-parser.php by Richard Keizer.

Please see the examples for inspiration on how to use this piece of code.

Contrary to pragmatic-parser, this parser produces a parse tree with PHP arrays.
